    "In the healthcare industry, data is becoming increasingly important. Unfortunately, a definition of healthcare analytics is not something that is concretely defined. However, I would define healthcare analytics as the use of advanced computing technology with the ultimate goal of improving medical care. Let's take a closer look at this definition.  \n",

    "### Healthcare analytics uses advanced computing technology  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this posting, we are roughly half-way through the year 2019. The impact that computers have had on our lives has grown exponentially...is showing no signs of slowing as we approach 2020. As we find it nearly impossible to pinpoint an area of our lives that is untouched by computers, tablets, and mobile phones, the healthcare industry is no exception. One of the major changes that we have seen in recent years has been a migration of paper patient charts to electronic health/medical records (EHR or EMR, respectively). Admittedly, much of this transition can be attributed to increased governmental incentives that are offered to providers for doing so. As this is happening, we are seeing a major uptick in various application and programs that are being written to capture demographic information, track vital signs, improve overall efficiency and communication, while taking major strides to improving health care for everyone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Healthcare analytics improves medical care  \n",
    "\n",
    "So, how exactly are we using healthcare analytics? The overall goal is to improve medical care. As broad as that seems, the approach has been broken down into three, more palatable, pillars--more commonly referred to as the healthcare triple aim: improving outcomes, reducing costs, and ensuring quality. Let's take a closer look at each of these aims.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Better outcomes  \n",
    "Intuitively, we can all relate to better healthcare outcomes. More specifically, better outcomes can include more timely and accurate diagnoses. This could lead to more effective and patient-specific treatments that we hope would not lead to any new infections. With hopes of an overall improved quality of life, despite semantic differences in defining \"improved quality\", we ultimately aim for improved quality and longevity of life free of unnecessary pain and worry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lower costs  \n",
    "While the goal is to have better health outcomes, unfortunately, there are finite resources trying to address an infinite problem. While various blood tests and orders for imaging can aid providers in the detection and treatment of different ailments, they are often exorbidantly expensive. Using computers, healthcare analytics and data science a patient's medical record could be subject to some mathematical calculaton and a few algorithms to create pretty accurate risk screenings for the different ailments, for far less money!  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensure quality  \n",
    "The data that is constantly being collected and analyzed is not exclusive to patients--providers are also having data related to their performance with their patients collected. The industry is moving away from solely paying providers for specific services, and is instead providing reimbursement that is more performance-based. WE DON'T REALLY CARE HOW MANY PATIENTS YOU CAN SEE IN A DAY...we care more about improving the outcomes of the ones you treat."

    "## Where is the practicality?  \n",

    "What does this all look like \"in real life?\" Well, the state of Florida collects emergency department (ED) data each quarter of the year. There is incredibly valuable information in these files. Each quarter contains roughly 2 million encounters (patient visits) and over 100 attributes for each encounter.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "But, having this sort of data can raise (and hopefully begin to answer) several questions.  \n",
    "##### What types of patients are frequenting the ED?  \n",
    "##### When are most of the patients coming (and is that contingent upon payer source or how they arrive at the ED in the first place)?\n",
    "##### Does Ethnicity and Race make a difference?  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "I decided to use four quarters for this project--quarters 3 and 4 of 2017 and quarters 1 and 2 of 2018. In the code below, I selected the columns of interest from the entire dataset. Below, I am showing the first 5 rows of the data, to see how the data looks and that the information is in the appropriate format."

    "Ultimately, with this particular project, I was interested in the characteristics of the individuals whom presented to the ED for a diagnosis related to opioid overdose/abuse. Those specific dx codes are shown below. I thought that it would also be interesting to see if there was a difference in the time of day that the patients presented to the ED. For the first analysis, I maintained the format of the hours of arrival (from 00 to 23). For later analysis, I adjusted the format of the time of arrival to reflect late/early. Late would be from 8pm until 8am (basically non-business hours), while early is everything else."
